* Also resizing behavior will be slightly different depending on what component you're controlling

## Components

### TextPane

* Bold, italic and underline
* Foreground and background color
* Font size and family

### TablePane
##### `TablePane` is just a collection of `TextPane`, but the size of `TextPane` will be changed depending on it's content
* The size of `TextPane` will be changed based on the percentage of max width of column
* You can multi-select cells to be able to set text attributes at once

### ImagePane
* Corner draggable points can be dragged to resize the image, it will retain current image's ratio
* North, south, east, west draggable points will break image's ratio, and new ratio will be recalculated

### CanvasPane
* Change line segments' thickness, color and position by multi-selecting or clicking
* You can also erase them using eraser

### ColorPane
* select predefined colors 
* custom color can be generated by three slider, each represent R, G, B respetively 

### FileMenu
* You can save file by clicking or using hotkey, the output file's extension should end with `.note`
* File size should be quite small, because we only save important attributes like size, position, text attribute, image data, line segment points, etc
